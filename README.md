This repository contains a collection of laboratory works that I completed during my university classes. Each code file includes comments at the beginning that describe the specific tasks and objectives for that particular piece of code.

Please note that while the core tasks are based on the assignments provided, I have occasionally improvised and added my own elements to enhance or extend the functionality of the original tasks.
